# Contribution Guidelines

## 1. Git

### 1.1 Some Git Rules

* Perform work in a `feature/*` or `bugfix/*` branch.

    _Why:_
    >Because this way all work is done in isolation on a dedicated branch rather than the main branch. It allows you to submit multiple pull requests without confusion. You can iterate without polluting the master branch with potentially unstable, unfinished code. [read more...](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow)

* Branch out from `develop`.

    _Why:_
    >This way, you can make sure that code in master will almost always build without problems, and can be mostly used directly for releases.

* Never push into develop or master branch. Make a Pull Request.

    _Why:_
    > It notifies team members that they have completed a feature. It also enables easy peer-review of the code and dedicates forum for discussing the proposed feature.

* Update your local develop branch and do an interactive rebase before pushing your feature and making a Pull Request.

    _Why:_
    > Rebasing will merge in the requested branch (`master` or `develop`) and apply the commits that you have made locally to the top of the history without creating a merge commit (assuming there were no conflicts). Resulting in a nice and clean history. [read more ...](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)
* Resolve potential conflicts while rebasing and before making a Pull Request.
* Delete local and remote feature branches after merging.

    _Why:_
    > It will clutter up your list of branches with dead branches. It ensures you only ever merge the branch back into (`master` or `develop`) once. Feature branches should only exist while the work is still in progress.

* Before making a Pull Request, make sure your feature branch builds successfully and passes all tests (including code style checks).
    
    _Why:_
    > You are about to add your code to a stable branch. If your feature-branch tests fail, there is a high chance that your destination branch build will fail too. Additionally, you need to apply code style check before making a Pull Request. It aids readability and reduces the chance of formatting fixes being mingled in with actual changes.

### 1.2 Git Workflow

Because of most of the reasons above, we use [Feature-branch-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow) with [Interactive Rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing#the-golden-rule-of-rebasing) and some elements of [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) (naming and having a develop branch). The main steps are as follows:

* Checkout a new `feature` or `bugfix` branch.
    ```sh
    git checkout -b <branchname>
    ```

* Make Changes.
    ```sh
    git add <file1> <file2> ...
    git commit
    ```
    _Why:_
    > `git add <file1> <file2> ... ` - you should add only files that make up a small and coherent change.
    
    > `git commit` will start an editor which lets you separate the subject from the body. 
    
    > Read more about it in *section 1.3*.
    
    _Tip:_
    > You could use `git add -p` instead, which will give you chance to review all of the introduced changes one by one, and decide whether to include them in the commit or not.

* Sync with remote to get changes you’ve missed.
    ```sh
    git checkout develop
    git pull
    ```
    
    _Why:_
    > This will give you a chance to deal with conflicts on your machine while rebasing (later) rather than creating a Pull Request that contains conflicts.
    
* Update your feature branch with latest changes from develop by interactive rebase.
    ```sh
    git checkout <branchname>
    git rebase -i --autosquash develop
    ```
    
    _Why:_
    > You can use --autosquash to squash all your commits to a single commit. Nobody wants many commits for a single feature in develop branch. [read more...](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/autosquashing-git-commits)
    
* If you don’t have conflicts, skip this step. If you have conflicts, [resolve them](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/)  and continue rebase.
    ```sh
    git add <file1> <file2> ...
    git rebase --continue
    ```
* Push your branch. Rebase will change history, so you'll have to use `-f` to force changes into the remote branch. If someone else is working on your branch, use the less destructive `--force-with-lease`.
    ```sh
    git push -f
    ```
    
    _Why:_
    > When you do a rebase, you are changing the history on your feature branch. As a result, Git will reject normal `git push`. Instead, you'll need to use the -f or --force flag. [read more...](https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2015/04/force-with-lease/)
    
    
* Make a Pull Request.
* Pull request will be accepted, merged and close by a reviewer.
* Remove your local feature branch if you're done.

  ```sh
  git branch -d <branchname>
  ```
  to remove all branches which are no longer on remote
  ```sh
  git fetch -p && for branch in `git branch -vv --no-color | grep ': gone]' | awk '{print $1}'`; do git branch -D $branch; done

### 1.3 Writing good commit messages

Having a good guideline for creating commits and sticking to it makes working with Git and collaborating with others a lot easier. Here are some rules of thumb ([source](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)):

 * Separate the subject from the body with a newline between the two.

    _Why:_
    > Git is smart enough to distinguish the first line of your commit message as your summary. In fact, if you try git shortlog, instead of git log, you will see a long list of commit messages, consisting of the id of the commit, and the summary only.

 * Limit the subject line to 50 characters and Wrap the body at 72 characters.

    _why_
    > Commits should be as fine-grained and focused as possible, it is not the place to be verbose. [read more...](https://medium.com/@preslavrachev/what-s-with-the-50-72-rule-8a906f61f09c)

 * Capitalize the subject line.
 * Do not end the subject line with a period.
 * Use [imperative mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood) in the subject line.

    _Why:_
    > Rather than writing messages that say what a committer has done. It's better to consider these messages as the instructions for what is going to be done after the commit is applied on the repository. [read more...](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2079612)


 * Use the body to explain **what** and **why** as opposed to **how**.
